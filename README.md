## Compiling Fuzion

**Note:** _Do NOT download or compile as the root user._

#### First, download the required dependencies:

__Ubuntu-Based / Debian:__
```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake g++ gdb git libsdl2-dev zlib1g-dev patchelf
```
__Arch Linux:__
```bash
sudo pacman -S gcc base-devel cmake gdb git sdl2 patchelf
```
__Fedora:__
```bash
sudo dnf install cmake gcc-c++ gdb git libstdc++-static mesa-libGL-devel SDL2-devel zlib-devel libX11-devel patchelf
```

---

#### Download the Fuzion source:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/LWSS/Fuzion
```

```bash
cd Fuzion
```

#### Compile with the build script

You can easily build with the included `build` script.
```bash
./build
```

You can later update with 
```bash
./update
```

## Injecting

To inject Fuzion, CS:GO must be open, but it does not matter what you are currently doing in-game. Try not to inject while loading into a map however, as this can make the game unstable or crash.

Ensure you are in the directory where Fuzion was built.

Inject Fuzion by executing the `load` script.
```bash
./load
```

**Note:** _Root priviledges are required for injection, and so you may be prompted to enter your password._

If Fuzion injected successfully, you will see the following message in the CS:GO console as well as in the terminal you injected from: `Successfully injected!`

If you see `Injection failed`, then you've most likely done something wrong. Make sure Fuzion compiled successfully.

If all is successful, you should see the following in the top left of your game:

## Using Fuzion

Now that Fuzion has been injected into the game, press <kbd>Insert</kbd> on your keyboard to open the Fuzion menu (<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> if you are using a laptop).

---

## Unloading Fuzion

If you wish to unload the cheat from your game, execute the `uload` script:
```bash
./uload
```

---

## Configs

Configuration files for Fuzion are stored in the following directory:
```
~/.config/Fuzion
```

Each `config.json` is stored in a seperately named folder, the name of this folder being the name of the config you will see in-game. 

To add a config, create a folder inside of the `~/.config/Fuzion` folder with a name of your choice, and paste the corresponding `config.json` inside of that folder.

**__Grenade Configs__** are stored inside `~/.config/FuzionGH`.

To add a grenade config, copy `config.json` to a folder named after the map the config was created for.
